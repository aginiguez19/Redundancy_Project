# Network Test & Setup:

### Load Packages

```{r message = FALSE}
library(qgraph)
library(igraph)
source("00_project_functions.R")
```

#### True Network Test

```{r}
# Use corr.gen() function to obtain correlation matrix
# nv = number of variables, EF = effective features of matrix
# edge. probability = probability an edge is present or not
true_mat <- corr_gen(nv = 4, EF = 0.5, edge.probability = .8)
# cor2pcor() converts correlation matrix into partial correlation matrix
true_pcor <- cor2pcor(true_mat)
#Graph
   qgraph(true_pcor, edge.labels = TRUE,
                  edge.width = 2.5, layout = "spring",
                  theme = "colorblind")

### Form 1: HCSF

```{r}
# Functions needed
# corr_gen() ~ Obtain true network corr matrix
# cor2pcor() ~ Move from corr matrix to pcor matrix
# hcsf() ~ Obtain redundant corr matrix that is highly correlated & same function

### Form 2: HCDF

```{r}
# Check weights argument input for betweenness and closeness

```
