# What is the most efficient method to grab the weights and the subtract them from strength correlations for Target?

# Testing Zone

# Create one partial correlation matrix 
one <- cbind(redun_pcor_subset, diag(0, 4, 5))
two <- cbind(diag(0, 5, 4), redun_pcor)
the.g <- rbind(one, two)
the.g
# Plot 
colnames(the.g) <- c("P1", "P2", "P3", "Target", "P1.r",
                     "P2.r", "P3.r", "Target.r", "Clone")

qgraph(the.g, edge.labels = TRUE, layout = "circle", theme = "colorblind", labels = colnames(the.g))


# strength
the_g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(the.g, mode = "undirected", weighted = TRUE)
total_strength <- strength(the_g)
total_strength

correlations.2.clone <- E(the_g)$weight[c(10, 13, 15, 16)]
correlations.2.clone 
total_strength[5:8]-correlations.2.clone

# structural.strength = total.strength - correlation.2.clone
# Could it be that I want to showcase the relations between p2,p3,p1 stay the same whereas the peripheral connections between target irrespective of the clone diminish...? 


#  closeness
total_closeness <- closeness(the_g, weights = 1/round(abs(E(the_g)$weight),2), normalized = TRUE)
total_closeness


# Previous routes become less efficient. The inclusion of a redundant node affects communication between the target node and peripheral nodes. P2 appears to be the most central node regardless of the inclusion of the redundant node. 

# betweenness
total_betweenness <- betweenness(the_g, weights = 1/(abs(E(the_g)$weight)), normalized = FALSE)
total_betweenness

1/(abs(E(the_g)$weight))
E(the_g)

# Originally, direct routes are most efficient. This is why each node has a betweenness score of 0. After the inclusion of the redundant node, node 2 has the highest betweenness score because the strength of relationships between the target and peripheral nodes decreases leading to a change in shortest paths.
